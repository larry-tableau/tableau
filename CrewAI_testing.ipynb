        "          This task involves a comprehensive risk assessment of calculation entries in the 'formula' column, categorizing each as low, medium, or high risk according to APRA's CPG235 guidelines. The agent will perform the following steps, aligning with the Chain-of-Thought, ReAct, and Train-of-Thought frameworks:\n",
        "          1. **Analyze**: Systematically examine each formula in the provided dataset to understand its complexity, data dependencies, and operational context. Identify potential information gaps such as missing data controls, validation mechanisms, or formula complexity that could impact data risk.\n",
        "          2. **Reason**: For each formula, determine its risk profile by assessing against key CPG235 data risk management principles:\n",
        "            - **Data Quality**: Evaluate whether the formula’s output is impacted by accuracy, completeness, or consistency risks.\n",
        "            - **Data Lifecycle Management**: Assess whether the calculation supports requirements for data capture, processing, retention, publication, and disposal.\n",
        "            - **Validation and Auditability**: Check for validation controls and ease of auditability within the formula, considering if manual adjustments or frequent recalculations could introduce inconsistencies.\n",
        "          3. **Act**: Incorporate CPG235 references to reinforce the evaluation, such as data validation techniques, audit trail requirements, or retention policies. If missing elements are identified, note recommendations for each calculation to comply with CPG235.\n",
        "          4. **Refine**: Based on insights and any telemetry feedback, revisit and adjust risk classifications to ensure accuracy, particularly if complex formulas are deemed high-risk. Adjust conclusions if additional controls are required, such as validation or periodic checks.\n",
        "          5. **Conclude**: Summarize the risk classification as low, medium, or high for each formula, citing the relevant CPG235 guidelines. Provide a brief explanation for each rating, indicating why a calculation entry was classified as such. Suggestions should focus on enhancing compliance and minimizing data risk through improved formula structure or controls, with clear CPG235 references.\n",

        "        2. **Risk Rating**:\n",
        "          - Assign a rating of 'Low', 'Medium', or 'High' to each formula entry.\n",

        "        4. **CPG235 Reference**:\n",
        "          - Cite relevant sections of CPG235 guidelines (e.g., “CPG235 Data Quality – Section 4.2”) that support the assessment.\n",
