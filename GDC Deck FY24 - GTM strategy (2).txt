Key Messages:
The Salesforce Professional Services delivery methodology is focused on driving speed to value on the platform while ensuring you’re set up for success the first time.
We use a lean agile and iterative design thinking approach that is designed to be flexible and complementary to your team and partner’s preferred way of working. 

— — — — — — — — — — — —

Talk Track:

We’ve focused on incorporating new ways of thinking and working so your business can optimize and thrive, but how do we actually deliver your vision?
The Salesforce Professional Services methodology allows us to drive speed to value on the platform, while ensuring you’re set up for long-term success the first time. 
We use a lean-agile and iterative design thinking approach to keep you on track towards your desired outcomes. 
Our experts start by breaking down your journey into 5 key phases: Discover, Define, Design, Deliver, and Deploy, with the ability to scale on the platform being baked into each phase throughout. Our continuous improvement model uses feedback loops to deliver MVP fast, while iterating and scaling for a future-proofed solution.  
And of course we know roll outs like these can’t be successful without stakeholder alignment, strong partnership, trust, and proper governance in place. This is why our experts drive continuous alignment and apply governance frameworks and processes at every phase to ensure we’re in lockstep with your team and partner. Even our largest and most complex customer engagements are delivered with operational rigor. 

Transition:
We help you use an outcome led approach with guidance every step of the way, taking you from vision to value, faster and we bring in our partners to help too.

— — — — — — — — — — — —

Want to dive deeper? Here is each phase broken down: 

Discover & Define: We start by understanding the challenge, opportunity, and priorities following relationship & design thinking best practices. We conduct interviews, build themes, find insights, and uncover the meaningful outcomes for your business we can help deliver. These desired outcomes inform every stage that follows and become our commitment for delivery.
Design, Deliver, Deploy: We use a design-led, scaled, agile approach, which includes continuous iteration of discovery and delivery as we prototype, test, and learn. We learn, iterate, repeat, while we build iterate and repeat and release a solution to the problem. This is how we deliver business value fast while we’re engaging with your team.
Scale with Continuous Improvement Model: Once we scale the solution into production, we take the feedback and insight gathered back into our define or design stage to iterate and improve. This ensures we’re designing, delivering, and deploying for the future, as well as the present.
